## One Thing Our Team Did Really Well
#### A mix between Interpersonal and Development:
One thing our team did really well was identifying different portions of the project that played to each individual member’s strengths, and dividing up work that way. We also prioritized which items were most important for each member to work on. This allowed us to get more work accomplished than we would have otherwise by providing a way to work in parallel and allowed the work we achieved to be of high quality because the right people were working on the right things. 

For example, Cordelia is a strong writer and extremely skilled at organization, planning, and documentation. Due to her skills, she mainly focused on different documentation-related tasks (playtesting responses/reports, tutorial system, website). 

Nikita is an experienced game designer and programmer who has participated in many game jams in the past. His skill set allowed him to tackle more complex systems such as the enemy AI and the turn-based player system that make up the most interesting parts of gameplay.

Sydnee excelled at adding to the graphics of the game, which catch the eye of players. She worked on many tasks including designing the different levels/game maps to gradually introduce information, deciding on assets to represent the player and enemies, and ensuring the visuals of the game represented the overall theme of spring. 

Skyla mainly focused on the miscellaneous tasks that needed to be completed around the game, such as the animation of the sprites chosen by Sydnee, the creation of player movement which was enhanced/refactored by Nikita, and the design of title/win/lose screens. 

## Evidence We Can Show For It
- The clean website developed by Cordelia
- The interactive enemy AI that Nikita created
- The different map designs created by Sydnee
- The animations of all the sprites done by Skyla

## If We Had Another 2 Weeks, 3 High Priority Items:
- Add an “attack of opportunity” feature that would let characters attack opponents once they move out of their melee range. This would add more strategy to the game by creating a penalty for running away, which addresses the note many of our playtesters mentioned about how the “run away” strategy makes the game easy/boring. 
- Adding more player actions, like a defend action that reduces the amount of damage a character takes, a heal action that allows a character to regenerate some health (something they could maybe only do once per battle), and a disengage action that would allow a player to move away from an enemy without being attacked by an attack of opportunity. This would increase the number of possible moves and strategies in our game.
- Adding a final boss of some sort to make the ending of the game feel more complete and satisfying. This final boss could perhaps tie in the theme of spring even more by having this boss be the cause of the approaching winter. Additionally, this would allow players to utilize all the different skills/strategies they developed during the levels.
