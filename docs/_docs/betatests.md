For the **Beta** version of our game, we implemented the enemy AI and added many more UI elements to explain the game. 
So it was a 1 player game. We still did not have a tutorial or level system in place.

# Conclusions
Here are some of our main takeaways and plans to implement the feedback we received:
- Make the end turn button more obvious - probably by adding the phrase "end turn" 
- Add a tutorial box to explain the turn system and movement/attacking controls
- Add a level progression - in the first battle you just have one deer, and then in future battles, you gain more characters 
- add some sort of feedback, effect, signal, or popup that makes attacking more obvious and feel more satisfying 
- add some sort of indicator or popup that explains what the enemy AI decides to do
- Add an undo movement button to allow backing out of a movement
- Fix the archer death bugs
- Fix the "deer" name bug
- Consider adding a scene at the beginning to explain the objectives (taking back the forest)
