# Conclusions
Here are some of our main takeaways and plans to implement the feedback we received:
- Fix the UI alignment issue so you can't move off screen
- Fix the enmeies moving away from characters and not attacking bug
- fix the enemies moving to dead characters bug 
- fix some of the tutorial box inconsistencies
- take away armor from the paladin at first so the tutorial isn't too hard
- Consider bringing back the damage information that would pop up after an attack 
- Consider adding an overlay over the dead characters to make it clear they cannot be used

Here are some elements that we will not have time to implement, but would add to future extensions of the game:
- Move the enemy AI to the left side of the screen to make it more clear that they are not a playable character and it is not their turn
- add an animation at the beginning to make the nature vs humans theme more apparent and the objectives more clear. 
- add attacks of opportunity to make the players need think about moving away, and to make other strategies viable 
- add more actions like a defend action, disengage action, or a heal action, to add more strategy to the game
- add a boss to make the end more satisfying and take more strategy
- implement our world map idea, where players can choose which battles they fight in 
- make the tutotial box more apprent somehow, so players won't miss it - and increase size so it is easier to read
- add other sounds, when players click buttons to give the players more feedback
