For the **Alpha** version of our game we had implemented the combat system. We did not have enemy AI yet, so it was a 2 player game. Players could move, attack, and kill the opposing characters. 

# 5/8/2023 Playtest
## Summary
We conducted a playtest with our classmates on May 8, 2023. This playtest had 18 playtesters and used the in-clas google forms sheet to collect feedback.
- AVG Fun rating: 4.11
- AVG Innovation rating: 4.17
- AVG Techical Challenge rating: 4.67

## Analysis
#### What Players Liked
- Many of the players mentioned they liked the art, visuals, battle map, and animations
- Some players mentioned that pathfinding and movement mechanic was satisfying and fun
- Two players mentioned they liked the strategy that comes from the different characters traits (birds fly, deers hit hard)
- One player mentioned that the controls were intitive 

#### What Frustrated/Confused Players
- Many of the players were confused about how the turn system works and why they could only move one character per turn

#### Small Bugs Mentioned
- Our deer characters did not yet have death animations or mechanics implemented
- Our indicator UI elements for which characters can be selected blend into the backround

## Conclusions
Here are some of our main takeaways and plans to implement the feedback we received:
- Add a end turn button so that players do not need to use all their movement to continue
- Add a undo movement button to allow backing out of a movement
- Add a tutorial box to explain the turn system and movement/attacking controls
- Make it more clear how the player characters have different traits (e.g. birds can fly) by adding more UI elements
- make the indicators for which characters can be moved more clear
